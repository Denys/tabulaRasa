# tabulaRasa

The tabulaRasa is a digital wavetable oscillator with voltage control of frequency, waveform selection, 
and the amount of interpolation between waveforms. 
The tabulaRasa consists of two components: a hardware synthesis module which can integrate
into a modular synth system, and a software application which allows the user to create their own custom waveforms. 
These waveforms are then transferred from the computer to the tabulaRasa module through a standard SD card slot.
